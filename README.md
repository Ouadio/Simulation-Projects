# Simulation of chaotic pendulum

## Definition :  
  A chaotic pendulum (also called double pendulum) is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions (== Chaotic Property). The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic (sensitive to initial conditions).  

## Code description :  
The code contains an implementation of the differential equations that governs the movement of a pendulum given its :  
- Length  
- Mass  
- Initial angular positions (theta & phi)  
- Initial angular velocities (theto_point & phi_point)  
- Time slots (time frequency)  
- Time span  

Besides, a GUI with input fields and check-boxes options is implemented, and displays animated simulations for tests.
